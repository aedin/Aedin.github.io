My research program in computational systems oncology develops multivariate statistical methods and machine learning approaches to integrate and analyze high dimensional genomics and single cell ‘omics data


Complex multi-cellular interaction in cancer and disease 
=================
Single cell ‘omics and spatial single cell ‘omics of cancer requires knowledge of different cell types and the complexities of cell-cell interactions. I have had a long-standing interest in complex interacions between cell types and cell systems. I earned my PhD in neuro-immunology at the University of Manchester (UK). I have contributed to research at the interface of tumor-stroma and tumor-immunology and more recently in COVID-19. I am a co-investigator on a StandUp2Cancer grant to study tumor resistance to natural killer cells. I am a member of the Human Cell Atlas Project and together with other [Bioconductor](https:://www.bioconductor.org) investigator, I  have funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Funding (co-PI) to develop [matrix factorization methods for integration of Human Cell Atlas single cell data](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/single-cell-biology/seednetworks/bioconductor-for-analysis-and-comprehension-of-the-human-cell-atlas/.
