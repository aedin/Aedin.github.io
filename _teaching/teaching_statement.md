Teaching Statement
============
**Experience in Teaching and mentoring students**. Most current teaching are [workshops in Bioconductor](http://bioc2020.bioconductor.org/workshops.html). I was instructor of winter session course, **Bio503 Introduction to Programming and Statistical Modelling in R in the Biostatistics Department at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health (2008-2016)**, in which I was responsible for creating the course syllabus, materials, supervision of a teaching assistant (2014-2016), awarding grades and office hours. The course attracted 20-30 students; undergraduate, graduate, faculty from Public Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I received several recognition letters from our department chair for positive scores from students who highy raated the class. I was guest lecturer on **Bio508 Genomic Data Manipulation**, **Bio290 Genomics and Genetics for Health Research**.  My initial skills in teaching were developed when I was a bioinformatics training officer at the [UK Biology and Biotechnology Research Council](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/) I co-instructed with Nadia Anwar and Simon Andrews on over 700 hours of 1-3 day hands-on workshops in Unix/Linux, DNA sequence analysis, phylogenetic analysis and protein structure modeling.

**Engaging peer-to-peer knowledge to advance science**. To promote open source software R/Bioconductor, I taught peer training workshops in data analysis of large-scale genomics data at Harvard, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York and European Bioinformatics Institute, UK. To engage the wider Boston bioinformatics community, I co-founded [Boston R/Bioconductor for Genomics](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-R-Bioconductor-for-genomics/) that organizes 6 meetings per year for academics, pharma, biotech companies and data science professionals. This group has been quiet during 2020, however prior to the pandemic regional impact and membership exceeding 750 members. Meetings have focused on Genomics in the Cloud, Single-Cell RNAseq, Pharmcogenomics, Drug Discovery, Proteomics, Spatial single cell transcriptomics, Containers and Docker, High Memory Computation, Multi-omics Data Integration. 

**Supporting diversity in the next generation of scientists**. To encourage students from disadvantaged background into science I have participate in the [National Institute for Health Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences program at DFCI](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/student-overview/) which is an amazing program.  I also chaired (pre-2020) the STEM committee, organize science events and in-classroom workshops at a local school to engage children in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.  

My teaching philosophy is summarized by the following tenants:

 * **Engagement**. The syllabus includes historical background, cutting-edge research and real-life applications. Students are given problem-solving opportunities, become actively engaged, “see the point” of learning, and are encouraged to master the subject beyond the content of the class.  
 * **Flexible instructional, supporting diversity**. Students come from diverse backgrounds and have diverse learning styles. Course materials are organized, support in-class, at-home and online learning, aural, visual and hands-on learning. Student progress is tracked through regular communication, assignments, and quizzes
 * **Foster Community and social emotional learning**. Students who feel emotionally safe, part of the community, display resilience and strive for excellence. Students are held to high expectations and failure is normalized. There is an expectation of accountability, respect and cooperation in a class that encourages curiosity.  Team activities build community and create peer to peer support

I always try to approach teaching with enthusiasm, organization and mutual respect because effective teaching and mentoring develop life-long learners.
